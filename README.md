This is the reporsitory for a manuscript entitled as "A Deep Learning Framework for Real-Time Prediction of Thermal and Structural Responses in Car Park Fires" submitted to Fire journal.

A CNN-LSTM framework is established. The database is generated from numerical simulatings using the software FDS and ABAQUS.

To run this code, Python 3 programming environment needs to be installed. Pytorch module needs to be imported.
